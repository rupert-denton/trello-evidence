Practice attentive listening and intentional clarifying questions will be assessed by way of written evidence and via observation by Dev Academy staff.

- Throughout bootcamp lectures I have asked a considerable amount of clarifying questions. Much of these during the technical lectures. These will be evident throughout the lecture recordings and in zoom transcripts (not sure if these are kept). 

-By way of evidence, this folder contains a screenshot from discord where I ask a calrifying question. This is pretty much my "style" ie I very regularly open clarifying questions with "just to clarify" or "just to confirm". 


By way of anecdotal evidence:
-I was actually surprised during the speedback session how many of my peers mentioned their appreciation for all the questions I asked, I didn't even realise I was asking that many!
