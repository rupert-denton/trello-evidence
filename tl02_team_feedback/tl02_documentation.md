Give and receive constructive feedback to/from team mates throughout bootcamp

Participated in all of the things as required. 

Some observations:

1. Speedbacking was nice but too hectic IMO - the process of giving meaningful feedback is a bit lost when we don't have preparation time and have to like speed around from room to room. Giving feedback to people I hadn't worked with at all didn't feel overly meaningful, I could only offer some nice comments about group checkins etc. but yeah didn't feel overly meaningful. 

2. Retros - good process but by the end of a friday we are all cooked, at least I am, meaning it felt a bit like 'let's just get this hurdle cleared' because we just busted our asses for 24 hrs to make a product and now we are tired. Ultimately, I found that the post-it notes on the miro were largely in the "keep doing" column and not many in the "what could have gone better" - again I think everyone was lovely to each other and supportive so there wasn't much like feedback beyond like "hey you are awesome thanks!' 

3. Receiving feedback - i actually got on the spot feedback from a fellow student when he said "Rupert, you speak so fast that I actually get more confused" or something that effect - I think maybe he meant it half lightheartedly - but, i'll be real, i was a bit take aback by getting feedback like that, in that setting (ie. with a bunch of other people around on the call) - i'd prefer feedback like that to be given like one-to-one. In any case I took it well and just sat with the slight frustration from being called out while trying to be helpful. Funnily, during speedbacking another group member was like 'when he said that thing, you took it so well' haha - so there you go.
