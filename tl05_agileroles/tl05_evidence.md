Git Lead:

This was a challenging one for me! I actually really like this role, having worked in it I can see two clear competencies (at least) needed to do this role successfully: 
        1: You need to have an eye for detail! I do not! So when I was in the role I just sorta waved things through and caused mayhem with conflicting merges etc. I learned quickly and second time I was git lead I made sure to check the pull requests properly and understand what was being done. I was also much more focused on ensuring people were working on branches rather than on main (including myself :)).
        2: Git lead needs to be comfortable with pushing back on things - if people want to rush through merges etc. git lead needs to just slow things down and basically act as air traffic controller. I am definitely a destination syndrome guy so learned a lot when Adam Chin was pretty much like "Shut up everyone and lets just do one thing at a time" haha - very helpful. I will channel my Adam Chin and tried to do so in later projects.


Vibes Lead, 

I can see the importance of this role, but during the 24 hr projects sorta found it got a bit lost or wishy washy. This was because in my experience everyone was checking in all the time so people all expressed the team worked well etc. When I wasn't vibes lead I was still checking in and trying to make sure quieter members of teh group were seen and heard - and I noticed others did this too.


Agile Lead/Scrum Master

LOVED this role. Really liked the structure, bringing people back to stand up meetings, putting time bounds around things. Methodically working through the kanban and helping people get unstuck. I did this role on the Pokedex Project and really liked thinking through how best to allocate resources/time and what tickets to focus on. Lots of fun.
