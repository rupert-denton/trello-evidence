What did you find challenging?

The biggest challenge with the HS deep dives etc. was more at a meta-level. The deep dives occur on a day when one my kids is not at childcare, and I often felt super indulgent doing activities like 'self-compassion' etc. when my wife is wrangling a baby and trying to tidy up after usual morning toddler storm etc. I definitely felt like I could be helping her out rather than offering myself compassion etc. knowing that I had taken some of the domestic labour off her hands for that time period and just made the whole day a bit smoother for her definitely played on my mind alot on Deep Dive days. 

What did you learn about yourself?

I don't know, I have a bit of a block up to a lot of self-compassion stuff etc. I think I am fortunate that I have generally pretty good mental health, self-concept etc. maybe 10 years working where I've worked has drilled into me that I am bloody lucky and nothing really is a problem. 

What will you continue to learn and improve on?

I really want to focus in on getting up with Tikanga and Te Reo - this is really important to me and I want to do well and explore.

Is there any behaviour you would lik eto try or change?

Slow down.
