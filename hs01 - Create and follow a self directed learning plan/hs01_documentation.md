So just revisiting my learning plan now, at the end - almost - of bootcamp. Happily, I followed all the things I set down. 

My high expectations for myself have definitely come through, I haven't really slowed down for BC despite having an okay grasp of 
the fundamentals of web-dev, where I could have maybe gotten away with clocking off at the 40 hr mark each week, I definitely, on average was putting in 50-55hrs each week. This was particulary the case when both our personal projects and a 24 hr project was due in the span of 2 or 3 days. I was working pretty much non-stop to get both things across the line to a standard I was okay with.

In terms of Human Skills, I definitely feel like I held back answering questions putting my thoughts out there etc. etc. like not to the point of saying nothing but definitely was judicious amount how much I inserted myself, I really was keen to hold space for others and, even when a question was followed by a long silence (something that actually causes me physical pain), I waited it out to allow someone to venture in - it was cool to hear from a diversity of voices and I liked how Rachey made space explicitly for people who hadn't answered questions during HS deep dives to have priorty.
