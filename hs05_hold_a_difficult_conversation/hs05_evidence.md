Demonstrate skills to hold a difficult converation

Over the course of bootcamp I haven't had difficult conversations in the sense I have had to provide critical feedback or whatever. An example of difficult conversation from a different angle that comes to mind for me was during a recent HS deepdive session on bias and representation in tech. 

While the content and questions to stimulate discussion were kinda general enough to be taken at pretty light levels (i.e. not delving into anything that made people uncomfortable potentially), my partner was definitely feeling pretty frustrated (not quite the right word) with things. 

I didn't initially pick up on this but definitely became attuned to body language and verbal cues that suggested this topic was bringing stuff up for her i.e. systemic racism, sexism and homophobia has been a real and lived problem for her and people she knows and cares about and so it is a very live and acute issue for her - not necessarily something to be kind of soft-pedalled. 

I think in these situations it is so important to you know, check your whiteness/privilege etc. and be humble and try and take people with the lived experience as the guide/expert through exploring these topics. It wasn't a difficult conversation per se but it was certainly fraught territory given all the things I represent as a white, cis, male, I gotta be conscious of this fact. I tried to learn and I also explicitly asked to be pulled up, stopped etc. if I did/said  something accidentally that was culturally unsafe - or, more generally, made the space feel unsafe. 

That was how I approached it...
