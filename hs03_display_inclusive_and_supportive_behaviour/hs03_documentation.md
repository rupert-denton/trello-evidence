Display inclusive and supportive behaviour towards all team mates will be assessed by way of written evidence and via observation by EDA staff.

During a human skills deep dive pairing, my partner disclosed that he was feeling quite low and found that the human skills sessions, while good, also caused him to experience quite low emotions because in his words "I go through the week during the coding sessions and feel that things are all okay then the human skills sessions happen and I have to reflect on how I am feeling and I realise that I am actually not feeling good." My partner went on to disclose that he suffers from depression, meaning the human skills tasks can be a trigger for negative thoughts and feelings.

I could sense that my partner was experiencing pretty heavy emotions. I really wanted to make sure he felt heard but also ensure that he was ok. My approach was to try and reflect back to him what he had just outlined to me, and affirm that the hs deep dives can be tricky in a remote environment, I also checked to make sure that he had supports around him (just asking "I'm sure you do, but do you have people around you and things you can do when you are feeling low after something like this?"). Its tricky ground to navigate, particularly with a peer you haven't really gotten to know but I made teh assumption that by disclosing these things to me he would be comfortable with me checking in with him. 

I made sure I checked in with him that afternoon and also when we had a moment (we shared a check in group and when our third member wasn't there I asked how he had been travelling mental health wise which he seemed to appreciate). 

My partner was also pretty introverted so wouldn't offer much up unprompted during our 15 minute checkins, so I made sure to always ask him questions as well to ensure he felt included in the social element of the checkins etc. 

I hope I did ok...!
